Micro News is a very basic and simple news script.
You can add your news which are stored in flat files
so you don't need any database.

Installation:

1. Upload all files to your web server.
2. Visit admin.php to add new content.
3. The main page index.php displays all news.

Troubleshooting:


- Can't see the news text
      Check the content of the news directory. It should contain all news. If not then change
      the directory permission to allow the script to write there.
